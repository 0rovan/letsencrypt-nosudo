#Let's Encrypt Without Sudo

**WARNING: THE LET'S ENCRYPT CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY IS NOT YET READY! ANY
CERTIFICATES YOU HAVE SIGNED NOW WILL STILL RETURN BROWSER WARNINGS!**

The [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) initiative is a fantastic program
that is going to offer **free** https certificates! However, the one catch is
that you need to use their command program to get a free certificate. You have
to run it on your your server as root, and it tries to edit your apache/nginx
config files.

I love the Let's Encrypt devs dearly, but there's no way I'm going to trust
their script to run on my server as root and be able to edit my server configs.
I'd just like the free ssl certificate, please.

So I made a script that does that. You generate your private key and certificate
signing request (CSR) like normal, then run `sign_csr.py` with your CSR to get
it signed. The script goes through the [ACME protocol](https://github.com/letsencrypt/acme-spec)
with the Let's Encrypt certificate authority and outputs the signed certificate
to stdout.

This script doesn't know or ask for your private key, and it doesn't need to be
run on your server. There are some parts of the ACME protocol that require your
private key and access to your server. For those parts, this script prints out
very minimal commands for you to run to complete the requirements. There is only
one command that needs to be run as root on your server and it is a very simple
python https server that you can inspect for yourself before you run it.

If this script is useful to you, please donate to the EFF. I don't work there,
but they do fantastic work.

##Prerequisites

* openssl
* python

You will also need to transfer the test key and certificate to your server
temporarily. The command printed out uses `scp` for that, but you can use any
secure transfer program.

##How to use the script

You run the script using python and passing in the path to your CSR (i.e.
`python sign_csr.py /path/to/cert.csr`). The path can be relative or absolute.

When you run the script, it will ask you do do some manual commands. It has to
ask you to do these because it doesn't know your private key or have access to
your server. You can edit the manual commands to fit your situation (e.g. if
your sudo user is different or private key is in a different location).

NOTE: When the script asks you to run these manual commands, you need to run
them in a separate terminal window. You need to keep the script open while you
run them. They sign temporary test files that the script created, so if you exit
or continue the script before you run the commands, those test files will be
destroyed before they can be used correctly (and you'll have to run the script
again).

The `test_*` files are temporary files automatically generated by the script and
will be destroyed when the script stops. They only contain test certificates and
signatures.

###Help text
```
user@hostname:~$ python sign_csr.py --help
usage: sign_csr.py [-h] csr_path

Get a SSL certificate signed by a Let's Encrypt (ACME) certificate authority and
output that signed certificate. You do NOT need to run this script on your
server and this script does not ask for your private key. It will print out
commands that you need to run with your private key or on your server as root,
which gives you a chance to review the commands instead of trusting this script.

Prerequisites:
* openssl
* python

Example: Generate a key, create a csr, and have it signed.
--------------
$ openssl genrsa -out priv.key 4096
$ openssl req -new -subj "/CN=example.com" -key priv.key -out cert.csr
$ python sign_csr.py cert.csr > signed.crt
--------------

positional arguments:
  csr_path    path to certificate signing request

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
user@hostname:~$ 
```

##Example Use

###Commands (without output)
```sh
#Generate a private key
openssl genrsa -out priv.key 4096

#Generate a CSR
openssl req -new -sha256 -key priv.key -out cert.csr

#Download the script in this repo
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diafygi/letsencrypt-nosudo/master/sign_csr.py

#Get Let's Encrypt to sign the CSR
python sign_csr.py cert.csr > signed.crt

#Output the CSR so you can see it
cat signed.crt
```

###Commands (with full output)

Since we don't ask for your private key or sudo access, you will need
to do some manual commands in order to get a signed certificate. Here's
what you need to do:

1. Sign some files requested by the certificate authority.
2. Copy a test key and certificate to your server.
3. Run an https server with the test key and certificate.

We've listed the commands you need to do this below. You should be able
to copy and paste them into a new terminal window.

(NOTE: Replace 'priv.key' below with your private key, if different)
(NOTE: Replace 'ubuntu' below with your sudo user, if different)

COMMANDS:
--------------------------
#Step 1: Sign the needed files
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign priv.key -out test_XhYOdY.msgsig test_vuK3N0.msg
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign priv.key -out test_Y5jK3k.dersig test_dQe_Zk.der

#Step 2: Copy the test key and certificate to your server
scp test_j3Lumf.pem ubuntu@letsencrypt.daylightpirates.org:test_j3Lumf.pem
scp test_RDBEK7.crt ubuntu@letsencrypt.daylightpirates.org:test_RDBEK7.crt

#Step 3: Run an https server with the test key and certificate
ssh -t ubuntu@letsencrypt.daylightpirates.org "sudo python -c \"import BaseHTTPServer, ssl; \
  httpd = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('0.0.0.0', 443), BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler); \
  httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, keyfile='test_j3Lumf.pem', certfile='test_RDBEK7.crt'); \
  httpd.serve_forever()\""

##How to use the signed https certificate

The signed https certificate that is output by this script can be used along
with your private key to run an https server. You just security transfer (using
`scp` or similar) the private key and signed certificate to your server, then
include them in the https settings in your web server's configuration. Here's an
example on how to configure an nginx server:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name letsencrypt.daylightpirates.org;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate signed.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key priv.key;
    ssl_session_timeout 5m;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers EECDH+aRSA+AES256:EDH+aRSA+AES256:EECDH+aRSA+AES128:EDH+aRSA+AES128;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:50m;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location / {
        return 200 'Let\'s Encrypt Example: https://github.com/diafygi/letsencrypt-nosudo';
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    }
}
```

##Demo

Here's a website that is using a certificate signed using `sign_csr.py`:

##Feedback/Contributing

I'd love to receive feedback, issues, and pull requests to make this script
better. The script itself, `sign_csr.py`, is less than 300 lines of code, so
feel free to read through it! I tried to comment things well and make it crystal
clear what it's doing.

For example, it currently can't do any ACME challenges besides dvsni. Maybe
someone could do a pull request to add more challenge compatibility? Also, it
currently can't revoke certificates, and I don't want to include that in the
`sign_csr.py` script. Perhaps there should also be a `revoke_crt.py` script?
